                        Based in NY ðŸ—½, I'm a student working towards a B.S. in Information Systems at Stony Brook University. I've developed skillsets with programming languages, web development, and database management technologies.
                        <br /><br />
                        In a past internship, I have also had the opportunity to not only be a part of but lead a new project that utilized API's to develop new technologies to streamline user inquiries about their lease sales website.
