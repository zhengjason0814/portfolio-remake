                Based in NY ðŸ—½, I'm a student working towards a B.S. in Information Systems at Stony Brook University. Throughout my academics, I've developed a skillset with programming languages, web development, and database management technologies through projects.
                <br /><br />
                In a past internship, I have also had the opportunity to not only be a part of but lead a new project that utilized OpenAI's API to develop new technologies to streamline user inquiries about their lease sales website.
